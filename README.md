# Traesu Project

## Overview
Traesu is a modern application designed to provide an enhanced experience for osu! Standard game mode players. This project aims to provide users with tools and features to improve their gameplay, track performance, and enjoy the rhythm game to its fullest.

## About osu! Standard Game Mode
osu! Standard (also known as osu!standard or osu!) is the original game mode of osu!, a free-to-play rhythm game. In this mode, players must click circles, drag sliders, and spin spinners in time with the music. The gameplay involves:

- **Hitting circles**: Click or tap circles as they appear on screen when the shrinking approach circle reaches the hitcircle's border
- **Following sliders**: Click and hold/drag along a predefined path
- **Spinning spinners**: Rotate around a central point as quickly as possible

Scoring in osu! Standard is based on accuracy, combo multipliers, and hit judgments (300, 100, 50, or miss). Players aim to achieve the highest possible score while maintaining accuracy throughout the beatmap.
